            <div class="project-title">OptimalHS Website</div>
            <div class="abstract">
                After gaining a little proficiency in django through building this website, I decided to venture on to a real, more intensive project.
                I built 'OptimalHS.org' in the weeks between the end of my second-year of college, and the beginning of my summer internship as a SWE.
                <br><br>
                This website tackles challenges like scheduling logic, database queries, recurring emailing systems, and admininistrative abilities through the UI. I built all of this with
                actual functionality in mind since it would soon be used as a centralized workspace for my friend's business. Although most of the functionality and back-end
                implementation is encapsulated within the admin view, I still tried to make the website visually appealing. So although HTML / CSS are not my strong suits, 
                I did pick up some skill along the way. I also built this using certain design schemas, such as DRY and highly cohesive, yet loosely coupled classes.
            </div>

        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">CRUD Course Review Application</div>
            <div class="abstract">
                
    </div>
    For my final project in CS3140, I teamed up to build a JavaFX CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for course reviews. This project taught me a lot, getting hands-on experience with JavaFX, SQL, Mockito, and boosting my problem-solving skills.
<br><br>
The process of designing and implementing the application allowed me to delve deep into JavaFX and SQL, areas I hadn't explored extensively before. We applied various design patterns to streamline our development process, enhancing the efficiency and maintainability of our codebase. Through collaborative efforts, I gained practical insights into database management and user interface development, honing my ability to tackle real-world programming challenges.
<br><br>
Throughout the project, I faced various hurdles, from fine-tuning database queries to polishing user interface elements. However, overcoming these challenges wasn't just about solving problems; it was about broadening my technical expertise. For instance, integrating various libraries for tasks like JSON parsing or unit testing using Gradle Build Tools was crucial for efficiently managing dependencies in a team setting.
<br><br>
This project wasn't just about techâ€”it improved my teamwork and communication. Collaborating taught me the importance of clear communication and task division.
<br><br>
Reflecting on it, this project shows how much I've improved as a developer. It bridged theory and practice, boosting my confidence.

            <div class="project-title">Portfolio Website</div>
            <div class="abstract">
                Crafting my portfolio website as a second-year computer science student at the University of Virginia was a pivotal step to broaden my skills beyond backend development.
                <br><br>
                While my background primarily centered on backend and low-level technologies, I ventured into frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and visually appealing interface. 
                <br><br>
                Despite facing challenges along the way, the project symbolizes my commitment to growth and adaptability as a software developer, showcasing my transition from backend specialization to a more well-rounded skill set.

            </div>
            This project, one of my first solo ventures, delves into computer science and AI. It combines two main parts: AI logic and a user-friendly interface made with Java's Swing library.
<br><br>
The AI logic uses pattern detection to decide its moves, analyzing the game board to spot winning or blocking patterns. If it finds one, it plays strategically; otherwise, it makes random moves.
<br><br>
The interface displays a grid for TicTacToe, letting users click to make moves. It also has buttons to choose X or O symbols and shows real-time game progress.
<br><br>
This project not only offers a fun TicTacToe game but also sparked my interest in AI and led me to pursue computer science. It marks the beginning of my journey in this field.
